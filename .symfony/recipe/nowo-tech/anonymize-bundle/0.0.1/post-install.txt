Anonymize Bundle has been installed!

The following files have been created:
  - config/packages/dev/nowo_anonymize.yaml (configuration)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This bundle is development-only and should never be used in production.

The bundle has been registered only for 'dev' and 'test' environments.
The command includes built-in protection that prevents execution in production.

To use the bundle:
1. Mark your entities with the #[Anonymize] attribute
2. Mark properties with the #[AnonymizeProperty] attribute
3. Run: php bin/console nowo:anonymize:run --dry-run (to preview)
4. Run: php bin/console nowo:anonymize:run (to anonymize)

You can customize the configuration in config/packages/dev/nowo_anonymize.yaml.
The bundle works with default values if you delete the config file.
